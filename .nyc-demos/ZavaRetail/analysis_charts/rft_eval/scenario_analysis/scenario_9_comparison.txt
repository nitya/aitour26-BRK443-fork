I’ve located your order #W7678072 (delivered 09/23/2025) for the Electric Kettle (item 2323972008, $146.98), and our return policy still covers defects within 30 days with no restocking fee. You have two options:

1) Refund the $146.98 back to your original payment (PayPal ending in …330)  
2) Exchange it for a brand-new Electric Kettle of the same model at no additional cost  

Which would you prefer? Once you let me know “refund” or “exchange,” I’ll confirm the details and then proceed—just reply with your choice.
