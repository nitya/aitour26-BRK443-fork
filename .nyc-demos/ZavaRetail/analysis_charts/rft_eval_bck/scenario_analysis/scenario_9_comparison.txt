Thanks, Noah—I’ve located your account (user ID: noah_brown_6181). To help with the leaking electric kettle, I’ll need the order ID for that purchase. Could you please provide the order number (e.g., #W1234567) or let me know approximately when you bought it?

I see your order #W7678072 (delivered 2025‑09‑23) included the 1 L glass electric kettle (item 2323972008). You’re still within our 30‑day return window, and because this is a defect claim (“defective”), there’s no restocking fee. You can either:

 • Return for a full refund (back to your original PayPal ending in …330)  
 • Exchange for a replacement kettle of the same model  

Which would you prefer? If you’d like a refund, we’ll confirm the refund method; if you’d like an exchange, please confirm you’re OK with swapping item 2323972008 for the same 1 L glass kettle (black). Once I have your choice, I’ll walk through the next steps.
